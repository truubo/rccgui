# rccGUI
A user-friendly way to interact with RCCService instances.
## Capabilities
rccGUI allows you to create jobs, close jobs, and execute scripts within jobs.
## Prerequisites
 - Python 3
 - requests
## Usage
Run main.py. Make sure the IP and port points to a RCCService instance. If you do not have one, you can self host one by running `RCCService -Console -Start`. I will not provide a source to RCCService, but you should be able to find it easily.
